      "Hi! I'm an engineer with a background in circuits and control systems, but I've always been more interested in how humans interact with the technology I build. In my work, I focus on creating systems that balance technical precision with user-friendly design—like reducing the learning burden for users when there are limited buttons or implementing fault-tolerant mechanisms to prevent user errors. This approach has a lot in common with Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), though at the time, I didn't realize how much I cared about the human side of things.\n\nEverything changed when I took a course on user-centered design. It was like a lightbulb went off! I realized that the process of understanding users' needs and then using technology to meet those needs was exactly what I loved. This spark led me to shift from pure engineering to design, where I could create solutions that bridge the gap between technology and real people. And so, my new journey began.\n\nNow, I'm excited to keep exploring how design can shape the technology we use every day. My journey into this new world of design is just beginning, and I can't wait to see where it leads next."; // Replace StringConst.PUNCH_LINE;

Having gone through it myself, I understood what they were experiencing, and that motivated me to create something that could make a difference.\n\nThe project combined an app and a device to help users manage binge eating by offering emotional support, distraction, group support, and motivation. I designed the user interface for the app to make it easy for users to access these tools. For the device, I modified a slap bracelet with Arduino and ESP32-CAM. It tracks binge eating behavior by detecting chin movement with FaceMesh and food with YOLOv8. The device sends real-time data to help users monitor their behavior and provide support when needed. This project was about creating a system that offers both emotional care and practical help to those struggling with binge eating.";

Our goal was to create a more friendly, connected, and accessible community. After talking to the riders, we learned that, unlike in many other contexts, delivery workers don’t need as much emotional communication. Instead, their primary need is clarity and ease of interaction. This insight led us to focus on designing simple, custom vibration patterns on wrist-worn devices that could alert them to important notifications without overwhelming them with unnecessary emotional cues.\n\nBy using my skills in Swift programming and device integration, we developed a communication system that helped them receive important alerts more effectively. This experience not only deepened my interest in working closely with users but also made me realize how much I enjoy designing solutions that meet real, practical needs.";

This experience led me to research women’s healthcare, where I found a strong need for personalized care and empathetic design.\n\nI conducted user interviews with five women to identify their challenges and needs in gynecological health. Using these insights, I defined the app’s requirements and designed over 15 high-fidelity wireframes on Figma. The goal was to create an app that not only provides AI-driven insights but also offers emotional support and education.
