## ðŸš€ About

I forked and modified the original **Aerium** project to build my own portfolio website. The design was inspired by [Pavel G's portfolio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/68081313/Portfolio-Design-Concept?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio) on Behance. It showcases my work and provides a clean, elegant design powered by **Flutter**.

Feel free to explore the code and see how I customized it to fit my personal style.
